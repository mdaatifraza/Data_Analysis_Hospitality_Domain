# Data Analysis in Hospitality Domain 

Welcome to my data analysis project focused on hospitality, where we delve into the art of data wrangling with Python.
This repository encapsulates the essence of my journey through a hands-on workshop on data analysis with Python.

## Learning Insights 🚀

Embarking on this project, I gained proficiency in:

- Mastering the basics of Python programming
- data analysis concepts and techniques
- the power of the Pandas library for data manipulation
- Crafting visually appealing insights with the Matplotlib library for data visualization

## Project Overview 🗺️

The heart of this venture involves the meticulous cleaning, transforming, and analysis of 5 different datasets. 
My ultimate goal is to prepare the data for a journey of deeper analysis and valuable insights.

## Project Structure 📂

- **data.csv:** Hospitality dataset
- **data_wrangling.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook is like our data wrangling diary. It's where we wrote down all the steps we took to clean and analyze the data
